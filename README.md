# Syllabus

An [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) addon designed to show deck statistics broken down at the deck and tag level.

Currently shows Total, New, Learning, Young, and Mature card counts for each deck and tag.

Respects tag and deck hierarchies, so tag:Foo includes stats for tag:Foo::Bar, and likewise for decks and subdecks.

Open Syllabus through Tools > Syllabus:

#### To Do

* On double click open browser on tag/deck
* Fix sorting to make logical sense - No idea what's happening now
* Add lapses and reviews in a way that is useful
* Allow for selective hiding of columns
* Export to image/csv

Please feel free to add any suggestions or thoughts. This is one of my first projects using Qt, so any critique would be very useful.
